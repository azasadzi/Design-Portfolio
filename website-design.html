                    CandEmo is an idea for a company that I created in grad school. CandEmo is the Original Emo Candy Provider whose mission is to "Sugar-coat life so that it sucks less for a little while". The company sells candy that is themed off of popular songs within the Emo genre, and also supports the mental well-being of its customers by providing mental health resources and standing by the idea that "it's ok to not be ok".

            <h3 class="h3-size">
                I developed a website for CandEmo for a graduate programming class. I designed the branding for the company, produced the graphic art and logo, and designed the layout for the Home, About, Contact, Music, and Life pages.  I then programmed the pages using HTML and CSS.  My partner for the project designed and programmed the product pages.

                <h3 class="h3-size">
                    I wrote the website content from a first person point of view of a narrator whose way of speaking is very blunt, realistic, and sarcastic. I made this choice to appeal to an audience that may approach life from a "glass half empty" point of view, but who also is searching for a way to make life better. <br><br> There is a consistent color scheme throughout the website, and an overall dark feel that makes the company stand out from other "rainbows and butterflies" candy stores.

                    The CandEmo website includes a Spotify playlist that consists of the songs that were used as inspiration for the candy.  The playlist is meant to be both nastaligic for Emo veterans and educational for those who may be new to the Emo genre. <br><br>The website also is functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
